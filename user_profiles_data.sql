doesn&rsquo;t matter','no','english, french, c++','i''m not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i''ll try to be as earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before the world.  i''ve lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i''m feeling like meeting some new people that aren''t just friends of friends. it''s okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly.  as far as culture goes, i''m definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don''t exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i''d like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don''t see me that way. that''s fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too.','i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance, noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven activities, i''ve been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi to try and gently flirt with ego death.','improvising in different contexts. alternating between being present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and raunchy humor.','my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i''ll come back to this.','okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it''s like being in the crosshairs.  for what it''s worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than fiction. it''s usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille, baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i''ll often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i''ve read of eco, perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.  directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky, herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang, gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc. but i also like a good amount of "trashy" stuff. too much to name.  i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which a 1-2hr movie usually can''t compete with. some of my recent tv favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the prisoner, lost, fringe.  a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay: art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers, maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings, omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk, robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit, juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b''more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz, techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.  a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly, mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski, samuel beckett, antonin artaud, tadeusz kantor, anna halperin, merce cunningham, etc. i''m clearly leaving out a younger generation of contemporary artists, many of whom are friends.  local food regulars: sushi zone, chow, ppq, pagolac, lers ros, burma superstar, minako, shalimar, delfina pizza, rosamunde, arinells, suppenkuche, cha-ya, blue plate, golden era, etc.','movement conversation creation contemplation touch humor','','viewing. listening. dancing. talking. drinking.

 as an aside, i think this question is best written by other people. so if you have any suggestions for what this part _should_ say, please do not hesitate to tell me.','books: almost anything fantasy: the lord of the rings (tolkien); the wheel of time (sadly, robert jordan passed away before completing it), the death gate cycle (weis & hickman); memory, sorrow and thorn (tad williams); riftwar legacy (raymond e. feist), ... also the da vinci code (dan brown).   movies: avatar, dark city, the game, inception, monty python and the quest for the holy grail, memento, pay it forward, ghost in the shell, and inside man. i also like cartoons; watching them and being enchanted by them feels like being a child all over again. mostly, i like to watch movies together with other people, so if there is a movie you are really excited about, send me a message and maybe we can go see it together.   music: i like various music styles, although i have a low tolerance for the likes of rap and hip hop. i usually listen to: classical music (mozart, beethoven, charpentier); symphonic rock (or maybe goth rock) (nightwish, within temptation, evanescense); punk (satanic surfers, bad religion, hladno pivo); folk music (the dubliners, saban bajramovic); dance (milk inc), techno (basshunter) and some mixed or harder to classify styles (zdob si zdub, haggard, dropkick murphys). i also like the - funny yet insightful - songs by tom lehrer. and man should certainly be in this list!   food: i like most of the food i''ve tasted in my life. i also like to cook, sometimes, especially for someone special. i love asian (especially thai and chinese) food. i don''t like liver, mamaliga, yoghurt, and probably a couple of other things.','happiness, fun, friends, hugs, fresh air, and the internet  i''ve lived extensive periods without these (sometimes lacking all of them at the same time), so, obviously, i _can_ do without them, but these things are so central to my life that missing one makes me feel incomplete.','life, the universe, and everything. me, my friends, and everyone else. programming, politics, and philosophy. the past, the present, and the future. i think (and fret) a lot. :-)  i care (and thus think) about fairness, the environment, animal rights, and programming languages.  my dream is to one day create a programming language that is suitable for interactive use and for writing large projects, and which is safer (in terms of mistakes one can make) and more flexible (or powerful) than languages in common use today. i have it all but figured out.','doing the same thing i do every night. in my case, that''s not taking over the world, but trying to make my world a better place, which will hopefully improve it for other people as well. for example, i maintain a website (http://inglorion.net/) with essays about things i feel people should know, and links to pages that i feel deserve more attention.','hmm, so you want to know my little secret, ey? well, i believe that, especially in relationships, the problem is often too _little_ openness, so i am more into telling as much as possible as accurately as possible, and sooner rather than later. there are really only 2 reasons i keep secrets:  1. because they involve other people. unless i know they are ok with it, i try not to bandy about things that they would rather keep private.  2. because i want to keep it for later. for example, i am not going to tell you what is in your present until you''ve opened it.  as for all the weird and wonderful things i haven''t told you yet...if you are interested, send me a message and start discovering! :-d','you should message me if...well, if you feel like it, really. there is no reason not to, really, unless you''re really not interested in me at all. i love to get messages from people. :-d  some reasons you might want to message me (in no particular order):  - you live near me and would like to meet up. i like making new friends!  - i checked out your profile, but didn''t write you a message. this probably means i intended to write to you, but lacked the time or was too tired. working full-time makes me that way. :-(  - you found something on my profile that you would like to talk about. for example, an interest we have in common, or something you agree or disagree with.  - you thought of a reason that you think should be listed here, but isn''t.',NULL,NULL,'Stephen Jones','https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/11/12/fake-people/4b806cf591a8a76adfc88d19e90c8c634345bf3d/fallbacks/mobile-07.jpg'),

(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden, meditate, do arty things, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start and almost never finish. (3) i own three chess sets, but don''t play chess. (4) in people, i like a precise mix of church giggles and smoldering contemplation; my friends, failing to achieve the impossible, tend to gravitate dramatically toward one extreme or the other. (5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i''m not sure why. (6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to smoke a cigarette. (7) i can yawn without moving my face. (8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter self-absorption. (9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators. (10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years. (11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch out. my height has been described by some as "gangly" and others as "elven", which to me are two very different things. i have also been told i resemble a "bundle of sticks." (12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a figment of her imagination she wouldn''t be surprised, which we agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult. (13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters, a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times. also, i think people who feel they''re too good to bag their own groceries are disgusting. (14) "winged migration" has been in my netflix queue for 4 years. (15) i have 35 plants in my room, a la max from where the wild things are.

quirky...but endearingly so (or so people say). i spend a lot of time looking for new (to me, anyway) music to add to my collection, looking for interesting events/activities/hobbies to try out around the city and revising mental maps of where i''d like to end up eventually. i love hunting for just the right vintage pieces. naturally, i''m an etsy whore, and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores, especially the alameda county antique fairs. my most recent vintage purchase was a gorgeous grundig majestic record console, i do believe it''s my favourite piece of furniture i own now.  i

appreciate being relatively close to the beach, after having lived in ny, where the beach was neither close to the city nor worthwhile. i like finding fun new ways of being active, like finding new trails to jog, paths to bike or walls to climb. going on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do, and a fun way to get to know people. i love all things creative, so art walks, gallery openings, live performances, museums, activities that involve creating art, are all places that i tend to gravitate towards...and i''m always looking for more people to that are also into

job. i tweet and facebook. and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the current goings on with the latest gadgets. but, i also read magazines like juxtapoz, big up, etc. because i love them and for the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up.  when it comes to friends, i''m super loyal and i think respect is important. bad communication in any relationship, friendship or otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion, and a personal pet peeve of mine. i like to be as up front as possible in most situations...even if that''s not what the person wants to hear.  eventually, i''d love to settle down with someone who i really enjoy, respect, and feel a strong connection with. ideally, i''d like for that person to be pretty different from me, into their own scene, but still have some interests overlap with mine. i don''t really like to rush into dating, but when i find someone i like, i tend to want to spend time, and get to know them. i''m a cuddler. and a hand holder. and a just because-er. and likely, a professional grade spooner. although dating-wise, this past year has been very mismatched for me, as it seems that i haven''t been into the people that have been into me, and vice versa. hopefully eventually, a mutual dig will occur...i wouldn''t settle for anything less.  things i <3. traveling, learning languages, hand-knit goods, mixed

if i had a partner, they could too. that is one of the benefits of my job that i haven''t gotten to take advantage of yet, unfortunately. heck, i''d want me for that reason alone!','here''s an obscure one: mechanical bull riding. when i lived in hollywood i bought a horse i didn''t know how to ride. but didn''t want my cool new horse friends to know because they were all really good riders. so i''d sneak out and practice riding the bull at saddle ranch on sunset blvd during the day when it was slow. a real bull rider friend coached me until i could go full throttle. i had crowds cheering and high-fiving me in the end. it''s really hard and it really hurts! and it is a huge adrenaline rush!!!','people always laugh when i tell them that i do have a shy side. it just doesn''t show up until we get to know each other a little better. then the real me feels more vulnerable because now i know you are realizing if you really like who i am. that phase is usually brief then i''m comfortable and at ease. i have so many amazing friends i know there must be some reason why!','i love the brain bending {science fiction} movies that are based on the writing of phillip k. dick. blade runner was the first. minority report, vanilla sky, the island, gattaca. star trek was awesome. another all time favorite was eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. fear and loathing in las vegas, real genius and better off dead from the 80''s, airplane, i read a lot about consciousness and the influence of psychedelics in religion, psychology,spirituality and culture. if i were stranded on a desert island: thai food!!! although sushi might be more likely to be on the menu, and that''s great too! malcom gladwell''s books. freakonomics for comedy, [patton oswalt] is the grand high master of all that is funny. basically, comedy would probably be my favorite genre of movies.','my passport my free flight benefits my amazing friends and family my sense of humor and youthful spirit my ability to create and share a unique and colorful existence with this little speck of infinity i have somehow been blessed with i''m pretty attached to my iphone. okay very. but i do admit to a fair amount of droid envy.','*when and where i am going to go next. and how i am going to afford it! *consciousness. spirituality, but from a more scientific approach. why we are the way we are. we have been asking the same question since the beginning and we still don''t have an answer. but people sure will fight to impose their beliefs on each other! *shamanism. how ancient plant medicine healers still connect to the wisdom of the living world around us. i think we have forgotten ancient wisdom. *i love learning about the psychedelic revolution of the 60''s and how it did and didn''t change the world. how the present day is different a a result. i just had the honor of meeting one of the great psychedelic chemists of all time. that was more exciting than any movie star for me. let''s just say if you''ve ever felt "ecstatic", he is why. i am a member of a non-profit organization called maps, which is devoted to legal research, such as mdma based therapy for ptsd. good work! *psychology. why we behave the way we do. why it is so hard to change, even when the change is for a far greater good. why we love who we love. *but here, in the physical realm, i really think a lot about the vast amount of plastic junk that just gets dumped into our landfills and oceans over the generations. why do we need to buy all this stupid stuff? how can it be better managed? is this planet really as different from when i was a child as they say in terms of extinctions and habitat destruction? *couchsurfing!

[ok fine- andrew bird and israel kaanoi kamakawiwoole.]  the town about bank robbers and good will hunting about a boy genius are favorites and i saw the fighter and liked it. i enjoy deep moral-of-the-story cinema and action like the latest batman movies, goofball like trading places. i liked punch drunk love, hearts in atlantis and thunderheart most of all. meet joe black was quite interesting- i enjoyed the metaphysical conceit and the performances. ummm... even though i''ve seen them so many times it''s hard to count, i may still be able to watch shawshank, the green mile or dances with wolves again. we''ll just have to wait and see. i enjoy any movie that''s got one or two of a few dozen actors/essess in it and i watch all kinds of documentaries on the netflix site.  i also like and eat food- especially thai, indian, or russian roots-style and the like. i meat eat but would like to phase more to the other side... i''m having a hard time, recently, reconciling my salivation response and appetite with my love of all teh cute, beautiful animals in the world- and the environment and stuff. generally, i steer towards things i can both identify and, if pressed, easily describe without suspecting that continuous consumption would make 7 in 10 people sick. the way i heard it, you''ve only got one body so treating it well seems best.','*mila the (lone) cat. just like many other people who have pets i think mine has special qualities and feel fortunate to be her friend.  *the car. my love affair with personal transport started early; i still feel lucky to be able to go somewhere the moment i have the desire. it''s a luxury i don''t take for granted.  *6 hours of sleep. any less and i get fuzzy around the edges and look all merle haggard. while staying up all night has a lot going for it when in good company or getting all ''task master'' on some project, i know too much about how lack of sleep makes me feel to ignore this too often.  *good friends.... familiar "well, duh" factor, i know. honestly though, people i love who i haven''t even met yet make me happy- and the ones i may never see again do too.  *a down comforter and soft sheets.

updated my profile to reflect the fact that i will be moving to san francisco on august 1st, 2012. presently i live in mountain view, so it is not much of a hike to meet new folks in "the city" as it stands already. standard profile begins...now:  i am a hopeless romantic. i really try to believe the best in everyone, and i hope for the best in myself. i regularly tell people i am the luckiest person i know.  i use 1980''s phrases like "keen", "rad" and "badass", and i am told i have a rather peculiar vernacular. i really enjoy talking...in fact if i am nervous i talk even more. i really love useless, but interesting trivia.  i adore traveling and taking risks as much as possible. i enjoy the rush i get by being pulled out of my comfort zones as well. my favorite places i have visited are paris, dubrovnik, sicily and hong kong. i have lived in richmond, va, baltimore, md, right outside of dc (gaithersburg), and now silicon valley.  i am actually an introvert, but being in high-end sales and acquisitions for years, i have learned how to carry on engaging conversations with practically anyone, so most people actually think i am super extroverted.  sarcasm is a critical part of my life, and i greatly value wit and cleverness. i enjoy "creative swearing"... anyone can say "shit", but "misanthropic fuck-tard" is a lot more amusing, and most likely more appropriate.  i am fascinated by robots, museums and multi-hour conversations. my favorite video games are galaga and mario kart 64. i love roller-coasters and people who smile all of the time. i can be very easily convinced to go see or do something just because it''s weird or new. i have dark auburn hair, am left handed, and i am an only child. i have been in the bay area for about 6 months and on the rare occasion i have a drink at a bar, it is typically a double shot of well tequila on the rocks, no lime or salt. i am very easily distracted by shiny objects, and i think i am totally awesome-sauce.','i have moved out to the bay area from richmond, va...where i still remotely operate that state''s comicon (nerdy!). i am still doing some publishing work in comics.  summer 2012 update: just finished publsihing a tmnt comic, and i am working on some robert crumb recipe cards to debut at the san diego comic-con in july. i will be moving from mountain view to san francisco on august 1st, 2012.  since moving to the bay are in summer of 2011, i have worked hard to lose weight...i got over 200 lbs (holy poop!) 2 years ago, but now i am back in the 170s. i really like taking walks, especially with my mutt, who has adorable heterochromia iridium (which, i am told, is a very groovy mutation).  previous gigs include television and radio voice-over work, graphic design, being a multi-spoken-language database admin, director of a failed dot-com (had to testify in front of senate for that one), being the #1 seller of comic books in the world on ebay, and acting as a primary vintage jewelry buyer for the highest rated jewerly store in central virginia. seriously.','building intricate stuff with a finite amount of steps. think...ikea furniture or legos. i believe i am

lol they don''t need a dad but someone that is teen-friendly would be a welcome addition to my life. anyway back to the soulmate thing. sometimes you just meet someone and everything is so easy and just falls into place effortlessly. the problem with that is sometimes it''s so easy you forget to view the red flags and warning signs. i would like to meet someone and keep my eyes open but still have the pieces fit together like that. i''m not a person that really has favorites. there are a few categories of things (movies for example) where i do have some favorites but overall i might have a consuming interest in something one year and the next year i''ll be on to something else. i definitely don''t have a favorite song or color or day of the week or anything like that. this makes me more flexible to be open-minded as to my partner''s interests but i have enough things that interest me and enough life-long friends that i won''t try to lose myself in the other person''s life but still have my own interests as well. i wouldn''t want to be with someone that requires so much "alone" time though that we don''t have enough time together. okay that was rambling but i hope i''ve said a little about myself at least to give you an idea of, if not who i am, then, who i would like to be with lol some interests: reading spoken word poetry (hearing) comedy shows live music hanging out with friends and family going to the movies surfing the ''net'' travel  i am awake, aware, and significant','spending far too much time trying to tactfully tell people that the word they are looking for is converse and not conversate.','spelling, listening, learning.','if they met me on the internet first it''s usually that my pics don''t do me justice. seriously i''ve heard that a few times. in person...my smile or my birthmark...depends on the person i guess...','i can give you genres but i''m not a person that has true favorites. something may be my favorite at the time and then i may not be able to recall the title or author at a later date.  books: most sci-fi although fantasy not-so-much. stephen king. i will read non-fiction (e.g. self-help) occasionally. urban fiction.  movies: everything with the exception of that goofy/slapstick type comedy and no extreme horror.  music: i like music. i like going to see live music. i like dancing sometimes. i don''t love music like i have to hear it daily or it has to be on whenever i''m in the car and i don''t really have too many favorite artists or bands. i guess i like mostly neo-soul, old-school r & b, gospel, christian, and "other" as far as genres i listen to most often. by "other" i mean that i like random songs from probably almost every genre of music except death metal or something like that.  food: i''m adventurous when it comes to food although i really have never liked most morrocan or indian foods and i rarely, if ever, eat pork. i like some italian dishes but not a huge fan of pasta. other than that i''m open to all types i like ethiopian, other african foods, thai, etc.','god, family & friends, affection, passion, books, iphone and i have to add in my dvr ;)','everything. i think i have add my mind thinks about all kinds of different things all the time. i have to tell it to be quiet.','lately i''ve been at home *gasp* lazing around watching tv or being on the internet. i have been reading more lately again. when i read a book i devour it. i can''t stand to put it down and have to read it all the way to the end even if i stay up until the wee hours of the night. i go through phases. sometimes i''m running around all over the place, doing this, doing that, never being home and then other times it''s like im in hibernation mode. right now i''m hibernating and occasionally i break free!','i actually watch the mindless entertainment we call television sometimes and it makes me laugh. i don''t have to say i watch it on hulu or online so that i''m different from the rest of the sheep either lol','you would like to get to know me better you''re single and available you''re easy-going, talkative and patient you desire a friendship that could lead to a long-term romantic liason',NULL,NULL,'Laura Torres','https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/11/12/fake-people/4b806cf591a8a76adfc88d19e90c8c634345bf3d/fallbacks/mobile-07.jpg');

(well maybe some intentional ones, like when i''m finger painting with chocolate pudding) if i like something, more is good, if not, there''s plenty else to try. i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my emotions, i wouldn''t trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big pleasure, i also like a day in my pj''s every now and then.  i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine, it''s such a rich and unique alchemy. what i''m drawn to in a a man is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who''s comfortable enough in himself that he doesn''t need to pretend, posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure enough that when he''s feeling something he can share it honestly. at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if you''re familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.  my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic, engaged, and a lot of fun. i''m drawn to connecting with those who are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to live, act, and make decisions from today. we all have shadow, and one of it''s favorite places to show itself is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that, and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty quickly.  i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i''m getting, than how i''m contributing, and i strive to have a positive impact whenever i can. i''m definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also need some down time to hang with myself.  although i love children, i''m probably not looking to have any, but i sure like playing with them. i wouldn''t rule out relationship with you if you''re a dad, so long as you''ve also got time and space for another significant relationship in your life.','spending time with my friends. enjoying the beauty of marin county planning my next fun and adventure hope to be traveling more soon growing and developing my business. i''ve been an entrepreneur almost my entire life.','dancing, one of my big pleasures expressing myself massage not taking life too seriously, though i love stimulating and intelligent conversation. taking good care of my body helping people feel at ease when we first meet. seeking pleasure - one of my big drives in life cuddling','my curly hair my smile for whatever it''s worth, i consistently hear that i''m more attractive live than in the pic''s. guess there''s something that just doesn''t quite capture when the camera''s flashing. oh well...','lars and the real girl is probably my all time favorite willy wonka and the chocolate factory a close second  i''m a big fan of byron katie and have read most of her books. also read a lot of relationship books since that''s my field. always more to learn. go through cycles of reading novels, lately mostly when on vacation and long plane rides. i''d subscribe to the new yorker if it came monthly, not weekly. otherwise they just end up in a pile, waiting to be read and then out-dated. one day...  i love good, and varied food, a delicious meal is one of my favorite ways to slow down, savor, and relax. one of the great perks of living near san fransisco, is you can sample the world''s flavors.','dancing touch, cuddling, massage, tactile yum laughter friends time for doing nothing chocolate covered strawberries motorcycle rides (as a passenger)','my next business direction & how i can best serve my clients my upcoming fun and adventure where i''d like to visit or travel to next how the world got so out of balance and what it might take to restore it.','with friends, dancing, seeing a show, hanging out, relaxing','if we laugh easily together, and you enjoy affection, we''ll probably get along.','you feel curious to know more your intuition tells you to  i make a point of emailing everyone back even if it''s just to acknowledge their gesture. if i reach out to you, i always prefer to get a ''thanks for saying hello, don''t think we''re a fit", then nothing at all. i think it feels better to be acknowledged than ignored. how about you?',NULL,NULL,'Rebecca Sullivan','https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/11/12/fake-people/4b806cf591a8a76adfc88d19e90c8c634345bf3d/fallbacks/mobile-07.jpg'),

i take everyone with a grain of salt, and i don''t tend to take anything too seriously.  i like to see people i care about as often as i can, but whether that translates to once a month or twice a week is fine. some people are busy, some aren''t - live your life how you want to, and i''ll be happy if we can do so together. i might really love spending time with you, but i''m not going to hold it against you if you''re working on a 60-hour week. likewise, i don''t want you to freak out if all of a sudden i have a lot of extra work & we don''t see each other as much for a while.  this is hilarious, btw - http://tinyurl.com/223fms-enneagram - it assigned me accurately, and the descriptions are (mostly) pretty solid. take it yourself: http://tinyurl.com/okc-quick-painless-enneagram - it might be enlightening.  p.s. i should apparently be somewhere between 6''4" & 6''6" according to the okc''s analysis of how people post height - but then i should be making "$100k+" as well, so what the hell.','i''m in transition, changing career paths from database administration to data analysis, working on getting better qualified for consulting & analyst positions. for now, my lackluster cover letters (or my terrible resume? no one really knows) have so far kept me cheerfully tuning queries & tables instead.  on a personal level, i''m mostly trying to pull it all together - build a coherent practice, be a better friend to people i care about (by replying to their messages more often and more promptly, by being on time more often), be more organized & effective in my life (keep everything filed & up to date, keep my personal space more tidy than not). it''s a process - i''m always working on something, some aspect of me that i feel i can improve. i have very high standards for me, even as i don''t expect too much from others, and sometimes i feel like every time i get everything dealt with, something else pops up that i never noticed before. maybe it''s a refining process, and i''m dealing with it all sequentially, but i doubt it - i think i''m just human, & doing my best to do a good job at living my life.  for business/career self-improvement, i''m teaching myself to use a couple of statistical packages & reading textbooks on business/process optimization theory (bring it on, nerds), and to help make my inside vision match my outside world, i read psychology & behavioral economics books (mostly popular/mass market, actual textbooks less often). i re-read this paragraph and i think it makes me sound like a dork, but there you go - either the rest of the profile shows that i''m not, or i just suck at describing my life. we''ll see.','empathy, forgiveness, welding, procrastinating, mountain biking, copy editing, endurance sports, changing everything from the inside out, remaining very still for long periods of time, making foods whose main ingredients are cocoa products, channeling, speaking with the spirits (am i serious? am i kidding?), loving, kissing, listening, negotiating, and breathing (you try it - it''s not always so easy).  i could use some improvement at: separating essential from inessential (i once got to the airport without a passport because i was too focused on which wallet it went in), allowing enough time for contingencies and emergencies (i''m working on it - see above), keeping in touch with people i like (it''s not even "out of sight, out of mind" - i think about them all the time, i just never let them know; again, working on it), writing concise sentences without excessive or semi-irrelevant detail (essential ... inessential ... it''s time for the end of this sentence).','an off-beat sense of humor, an overall sense of relaxed composure, a wry smile, and my excellent dress sense. if by "excellent", it is understood that i mean "encompassing the well-bred gentleman''s ideals of bespoke suits cut and blended with ''50s loungewear and occasionally clothes from the ''70s that are clearly a cruel joke perpetrated on an unsuspecting and unfashionable public." why, you might ask? why on earth do you ever willingly, knowingly, wear polyester? because you can''t wear clothes that even a retired, color-blind golfer in florida would find embarrassing without bringing a feeling into the room that maybe more fun should be being had right now. maybe you have to be there, but it''s true - although you wouldn''t find this out for a while after we met, if we met, because i find the opposite effect to be in force in casual first encounters: it''s just too hard to get past the plaid.  regardless of what people notice, they often like me for no apparent reason, pretty much right off the bat (maybe there are factors neither i nor they are aware of, but it usually seems like people like me basically just because i''m there - it''s almost weird, except that''s just how it is; my current theory is that i make people feel good about themselves because i''m very non-judgmental and because i see the good parts first, and the bad parts often only much later; thus, seeing themselves reflected as though through a glass, brightly, perhaps they think to themselves, "who is this jovial fellow, this man amongst men, this keen-eyed rogue who sees me as the princely soul i am?").  i really have got to do something about the parentheticals - footnotes would look stupid, so clearly drastic cuts are in order. for now, suck it up until i fix it, wiki-edit it, or send me hate mail about how terrible it is - i''ll be impressed you read this far down the page, either way. well done you! there will be a quiz at the bottom.','i like to read mind-bending fiction (e.g. philip k. dick, some borges, even huxley) that takes you to another mental place entirely, i''ll watch any movie that makes me feel different after i''ve seen it, and i''ll eat just about anything (not beets - i love their flavor, but it would seem that i''m allergic to them; think ''exorcist,'' or actually, don''t).  specifically, i love southern food in all its incarnations, especially collards, beans, & gumbo. i like fried cheese (it sounds terrible, i know, but it''s actually good for you if you fry it in grapeseed oil, because it''s better for you than cheese fat, & frying the cheese sort of clarifies it - plus, it''s delicious if you crisp the cheese on the outside & serve it on crostini with tomato salsa) and all sorts of things that aren''t supposed to be very good for you (no junk food, though - processed foods never taste or feel that good to me). i could eat roast vegetables every day, and fried collard greens with bacon & peppers five times a week.  the last movies i saw in a theater were mulholland drive (don''t judge me, it was a retrospective), which i still find to be quite thought-provoking, and john carter, which i enjoyed largely because the 3d was excellent & because i''m a long-time fan of edgar rice burroughs. it doesn''t belong in ''films,'' but i''m so exceedingly amused by the venture brothers series on adult swim that i''m putting it here anyway. i would date someone solely because they liked watching the venture brothers and futurama with me, although i don''t know how long that would last (about seventy episodes, i guess).  i don''t have favorite music, just music that i listen to a lot at a given time. once i start listening to an artist or a genre, i get everything i can in that vein and listen it to death or until something else catches my fancy. at the moment, it''s led zeppelin crossed with bootleg live fatboy slim & aphex twin mixes, ambient dub, and noise (that last is new - i''m not really feeling it yet, but it comes recommended so i''m giving it time). i also like grime & uk dubstep imports, but as i say that i realize it''s getting harder & harder to find good dubstep, as there''s so much tat put out by labels who are capitalizing on a stereotype of the sound but not really encapsulating the feeling.','parenthetical remarks (judging by the above as samples). the company and contact of people i like. kisses, touching, etc. exercise, fresh air, and a change of scenery. options - i hate being boxed in. sunscreen (most of the time). time to think & reflect, or to feel & respond to the moment.  (does anyone count these six things? message or im me if someone has ever corrected your seven-list, or grammar, or punctuation - i''m just curious, because i sometimes get the urge to fix someone''s comma splices or obvious misspellings and malaprops, but then i think to myself that if it mattered to them, they''d run the spellchecker before submitting it, and then i''m just the fastidious idiot fussing over nothing).','neurological functions (synapse repair & proliferation, neurotransmitter pathways, how to make my brain work better & smarter).  what i''m going to do with the rest of my life (what i want to do for money, where i want to be, physically & otherwise, in 5 years, how to live in such a way that when i look back at 85 i''m happy with my choices).  now - or rather, not thinking about now, but being in it.','swing dancing at a ballroom, or at a bar or a show with friends. i don''t tend to drink much, but i tend to like hanging out with people who do (go figure), so it works out well enough anyway.  as an aside, i''m amused at how many people won''t admit to having a "typical friday night" to write about -- at a certain level, i think it bespeaks a little bit of denial (that you''re as knowable as everyone else) or perhaps a lack of self-knowledge/self-examination if you can''t look back & recognize your patterns; contrariwise, if you truly have no patterns, that is in itself a little odd to me. i don''t mind if your pattern is "go out & do something that i''ve never done before" or even "write a numbered list of the top results from a google search of sf activities this weekend ... and then roll a 20-sided die" but i suspect if you actually look at your life, there probably is a pattern.  (maybe i''m being too literal here. ahem.)','i get along really well with people who are many kinds of high (though i tend to be almost straightedge). why is this private? several times i have found myself at a party where i know a couple of people but i seem to get along really, really well with everyone - they seem to be a lot more like me than most people are, more friendly, talkative, and upbeat than usual, and less rigid, self-absorbed, or uptight. and i have thought to myself, "these are my people. i feel at home with these people, like just another one of many rather than someone who is always a little bit different." when it becomes clear, later, either because someone makes it obvious or perhaps a party-goer later mentions that the reason why people seemed different that night from how they have been since is because just about everyone else was high before i got there, it makes me wonder - if i think those folks are like me, what am i like?  in the end, though, i realize it''s just a thing i have to come to terms with: i, like so many of you reading this, am just a little bit different from most people - we''re all unique individuals, certainly, and although some of us may seem to be a bit more unique, for some reason, the fact remains that this is the life you have and your best option is to live it as well as you can. so be it!','you think you''re smart, interesting, heartful, curious, or fun to spend an afternoon with. i''m looking to expand my circle of people that i connect really well with, or even just find more folks who like to do new things & have more fun than they probably should (according to their more boring friends).  i admit (as you''ll know, if you''ve read the foregoing), i''m not short of friends & people i''m currently not sending postcards to or calling, so if we don''t get along pretty well pretty quickly then it might not work out, but i reckon it''s worth coffee or cocoa to find out.  also - please message me if you have any suggestions for books or music, either because you think i''d like them for some reason or because you think so highly of something that you reckon everyone should take a gander at it. double bonus if you can give a precis of content - in fact, i''d be really impressed. i''m still working on that for my own reference (helps me remember themes, details, outcomes).  lastly, please don''t be offended if you im or message me and it''s a little while before i get back to you - for one thing, see above re: responding to mail, but also i have firefox''s okc plugin, so it looks like i''m online all the time, regardless of where i am. i''m (probably) not ignoring you, i''m just not there.',NULL,NULL,'Jason Jackson','https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/11/12/fake-people/4b806cf591a8a76adfc88d19e90c8c634345bf3d/fallbacks/mobile-07.jpg'),

(just last month someone got me climbing the stanford dish) i love camping even though i haven''t been in a long time, it''s just the hiking and climbing stuff that is tough for me to handle.

debauchery.','not peeing on the toilet seat, tying my shoes, urban combat operations, paying bills on time and watering my plants.

we like to keep things spicy (oh no he didn''t) in the bedroom every now and then by throwing in some distilled agave for a little menage a trois action.  when it comes to music i like it all. the one artist you absolutely must know is city and colour....the album bring me your love is probably the best collection of songs by any one artist.....period.  i''m usually reading some sort of science text for school but in the offseason some of my favorites from the past include.... the god delusion, the fountainhead, a people''s history of the united states, freakonomics, how doctors think and everyone poops.....so inspirational, changed my views on life.  as for movies i''m a fan of comedies or anything with witty dialogue, especially films with some cheesy romantic theme hidden within the story line. good will hunting is a classic, i''ll have words with anyone who says otherwise....i''d like to say that i''m only into foreign or indi films just because it sounds so much more intelligent. the truth is that to me, it seems as though a good number of them are intentionally shot from a shitty and over elaborate perspective, ultimately muddling the general composition of the piece and detracting from what could have been a really great film. like anything in life, some are great and some are complete shit...just because i don''t understand it doesn''t make it amazing.','there are 7 dwarfs, it''s not polite to leave someone out....but if we''re losing the dead weight i say grumpy has to go. who wants to hang around a miserable prick all

(feel free to skip over the section on books, films, food, etc. or any other section for that matter)  generally speaking, i am very content with myself and my life, yet i miss that special magic that two people can create together; and i really miss sharing the journey through life, and all the little and big ways that a relationship adds to my life.  on first dates, i''m often told that i''m really easy to talk with and very easy to be with. i suppose this is largely because i''ve grown quite comfortable with myself and who i am. i''ve worked on myself a lot for over 3 decades, and, while still/always a work-in-progress, i''ve come a long way in myself and in my life. i''m happy and i enjoy life. also, i have a lot of interests, i listen well and converse easily. i''m very curious about people and mostly non-judgmental.  those that know me describe me as very kind, feminine, extremely sweet, soft yet strong, gentle and firm, very present, calm, grounded, compassionate, lively, passionate, insightful, relaxed, very affectionate, interesting, super bright, curious, funny, multi-talented and creative, nurturing, generous, fun, and spontaneous...... though usually not all in the same sentence. i''m intense at times, but in a good way. men often ask me how it''s possible that i''m unattached. those that know me really well would add that i''m wise, exceptionally sensitive, intuitive, and a bit of a sprite. you''ll know i''m comfortable with you when you get to experience the sprite in me. :)  i have a huge heart and love full out. hopefully, you do too. that''s where the 2heartsdelight happens. you''d need to be ok with being loved completely.  i have a very curious mind. i ask a lot of questions- not all of them aloud. i''m told i ask great questions. and, i don''t have a need to always have conversation in the company of another. i''m fine with just being especially once we know each other a bit and are comfortable with each other.  i''ve developed awfully good communication skills and excellent relationship skills. men in recent years have found me rather remarkable in this way and in other ways too. i hold up my end of a partnership/relationship rather well and can let you have your experience w/o getting reactive and can manage my own experience w/o needing to process it with you. ideally, you''re able to do the same. i''m past the point of needing to process a bunch of stuff in relationships. hopefully you are too. we''ll process only that which needs to be processed together; the rest we''ll each handle on our own. let''s enjoy sharing the journey. harmony in relationship is absolutely paramount to me; life is short.  i''m a long time student (over 23 years) of the diamond approach in the ridhwan school and also of yoga. i have very very high integrity. i almost always take the high road- even in the worst of times. i''m iconoclastic, autodidactic, and very self-aware.  i live on the edge or beyond the edge of my comfort zone most of the time: my soul is on some sort of fast track. the rate of growth/transformation can be quite rapid;

(except for uggs/affliction/edhardy .. just .. no. :p )  i have a keen eye for aesthetics/beauty in style/design/women. design in general (architecture, game, photography, art, etc) fascinates the heck out of me. and draw something.  i also excel at being a thesaurus (caught onto that, yet?) and understanding the subtle nuances between what would seemingly be synonyms (but not quite). words with friends.  i''m also good at jumping between multiple types of humor and pointing out absurd irony. (jon stewart, steven colbert, and the onion? easy laughs) i find a lot of things funny, sometimes they''re not always appropriate. if you''ve ever described your sense of humor as warped or perverse, we''ll at least have that.  things i''m not good at - keeping it brief. things i''m good at - understatement, or stating the obvious. ''yay! you''re (only) half-way through my profile!''  i can carry my end of the conversation quite well (it helps if you''re also curious and if i find you or your life intriguing ;) )  going off on tangents. and tangents from those tangents. and then segues. having a barely contained attention span (at best). squirrel!! creative thinking. sometimes even creative doing. imagining things. overthinking things. :)','my hawk or my facial expression(s). sometimes my sense of ''style'' (that''s a little difficult to adequately explain). honestly, this depends on the venue/situation in which i''m noticed and i actually want to be overtly noticed. (sometimes, i aim for the double-take effect, just to see who''s paying attention)','books (recent) - the geeks shall inherit the earth, consuming instinct, tipping point, steal like an artist, currently working on a whack on the side of the head [feb 2012] (i try to get around to a book every month or two .. the personal library is a ikea billy bookcase or three) ..  movies - star wars franchise, inception, dark knight, back to the future 2, beautiful mind, princess bride, meet joe black, city of angels, time traveler''s wife. i could probably come up with a top 5-10 list by genre, i like watching movies that much. while i enjoy off-beat romantic comedies (think sandler), i''m moreso drawn towards tragic romances.  shows (current) - big bang theory, suits, archer, white collar, snl (yeah, i know, still), wwe (it''s my guilty indulgence. don''t harangue at me if you watch bachelor(ette) ;) ) (old) - smallville, friends  music - i have a wide array of artists/bands/genres i really like. i''m such a (creative) geek about it, i created a word cloud to visually depict what artists are most represented in my spotify account. (see my pictures section) in terms of artists that i will actually still buy cds of - linkin park, lady gaga. i also love going to concerts (several times a year) and sometimes cirque/musicals (once or twice a year).  food - seafood (yes, most of it, and capitalized :9 ). maybe not crawfish/crawdads-totally overrated, imo. salmon is one of those foods i could live with on a deserted island. desserts. i also make bomb spaghetti. i''ve been known to bake and or experiment with it.  sports - baseball. specifically, the oakland a''s. i''ve been a season ticket holder for a decade and a lifelong fan. which also means i will almost never set foot in the other ballpark unless i absolutely have to (and even then, i really don''t enjoy myself there). football, the niners primarily (though i also root for the steelers and packers). college football, my alma mater - cal (uc berkeley for the non-californians). basketball and hockey, i loosely follow and will root for the warriors and sharks.','aside from the basics? my bear, my atm card, internet, seafood, entertainment (music and movies), conversation.','everything. my opinions and perspectives on things. my place/purpose in the world and where the universe might be nudging me. figuring out where i truly fit in, or coming to terms with the possibility that i''ll need to accept a partial fit in different places.  unraveling my pre-existing paradigms and wondering i''ll meet someone similarly minded. if you''ve made it this far, you have a lot of patience, or curiosity (both quality traits). thanks!  .. about how finding someone would be a lot easier if i were one-dimensional and/or lived a non-complex life. but then again, i like being multi-dimensional, so that''s my cross to bear.  i''m a bit add, so my thinking goes *all* over the place. it''s a bit of a wonderland rabbit hole trying to follow my train of thought sometimes. if you''re truly curious enough to keep up, i promise it''ll be an entertaining trip ... :)','hard to say ''typical''. in a typical month, there''d be - out with friends, watching a movie, vegging at home.','i am not a ''goody-two-shoes'' and i have a *very* flexible world view. if it''s not causing long-term damage to others or oneself, i probably don''t have a problem with it. being an explorer type (google explorer director builder negotiator), i''m very much willing to experiment and try/do things that 90% of people would shy away from (read into that as you will :) ) i''m also looking forward to meeting more of the 10% types.','if i''ve caught your attention and you''re the curious type.  also, if you''d like to casually chat about what these %match, %friend stats really mean and how could they could be derived (do we really have that much in common? how so?) is 84% match that different from 92%? does 72% mean we shouldn''t bother? if you''re as curious as i am (or moreso), i''m sure it''d be a fascinating conversation.  if you clicked on me from the bottom left of someone''s profile "similar types" because it said i was ''more adventurous'' or ''more kinky'' (i really want to know how it would come to that conclusion)  if you''re the adventurous, world of possibilities type, we''d probably get along. if you''re a fellow "i want to show you something / someplace cool" kinda chick, we''d probably get along. overall, i''m about a 60/40 leader/follower, so if you don''t mind taking the reins some of the time, i''m a willing partner in crime (depending on the ''crime'', but usually i''m game, and i''ve probably done worse). basically, if your subconscious inspiration/approach to the world is calvin and hobbes (or alice in wonderland), we''d probably have a blast.  major points if you''re an entp - http://www.okcupid.com/quizzy/results?quizzyid=15726823159642562891&userid=4689483974412035844  also, if you''re just a little gullible, because i''m 5''10", not 6''. ;) (if you''re >this< close to messaging me and 2" is the deal-breaker, we''re probably on different ''let''s take a chance'' levels :) )',NULL,NULL,'Dennis Ali','https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/11/12/fake-people/4b806cf591a8a76adfc88d19e90c8c634345bf3d/fallbacks/mobile-07.jpg'),

meeting. i am very passionate about a great deal of things and will talk about them for days. trying to take time to make community of creative types but center on building connections. this is my second account on this site as i saw significant changes in my outlook on life. i relish in the fact that i can take opportunities to rediscover myself.  the main reason i have come to like this site is the possibilities or potential to connect with someone. unless you live in the bay area or are planning to i have little time to develop or devote to someone i have no chance of seeing face to face unless they give some compelling reason. that would include but not limit things that pertain to what is on my profile here. i will quiz you on what is contained here.  i believe in connection. it is more important than anything and have a passion about it. i am extremely serious about this. if you want to ask me about this be prepared for a long response.  i have boundaries and abide by them.  the next thing that is very important is that i ignore people who do not have a match percentage at all and try to use this site for ads to their other web pages. take some time to fill out a few of the questions and profile. thanks.  i am intense, positive, and artistic','i seem to have difficulty finding work that will not just give empty promises.  i am learning about reconnecting with myself and those who are of similar mind. of late i have considered what it means to be me in a greater sense. this is another reason i am on this and other sites. if you get a message or comment from me it is likely that i have found a connection point with you.  always looking for those who can understand what dreaming really is.  testing the limits of sane and safe behavior in the insane world we all have created.  watching my daughter drive everyone crazy.  finding the humor in just about everything about me.  enjoying the new connections in my life and living them to the fullest.  telling the people who are important to me that they are loved.  teaching my daughter how to recognize the limits that humans have to deal with on a regular basis.  coping with the moments as they come to me.  finishing the questions on this site and hoping that some good friends come out of it. i will also send a message to those that message me. being one with the universe. thinking on changes that are happening to my life. trying to see things as they really are not what they seem to be. listening for the little things that add up to the bigger ones. listening to the soul of things as i see it. trying to make connections with others.','...being in the right place. foot rubs. i also seem to have the ability hold people''s attention without even trying sometimes. noticing people who notice things around them.getting the trust of complete strangers. touching the soul of others. pushing the limits of creativity.','my eyes or my hair.  i have very intense eyes that people say look right through things. the other thing is that sometimes i seem really tall. the intensity is what usually gets most people. my intensity is shown in just about all of me. i welcome your messages to tell me what you see.  i occasionally color my hair to help thin it and keep the white at bay for the moment. my hair is longer now and still very thick. i have a love of hair that borders on a fetish. the longer the better. apparently the color of my hair is a very interesting topic for the moment.','books: i have a deep love of just about anything by isaac asimov. robert heinlein is also up there. i have been reading science fictionsince 7 years old. ray bradbury is really good too. neil gaiman is probably my favorite now. i think i am starting to like terry brooks as well. i have a lot of books about the stuff that i am interested in and am trying to find a way to compose my own. philip pullman is on the list too. i just realized that c. s. lewis is also big on my reading list. i have a large collection of supernatural beings in my collection. yes even some old d&d novels are in there. everyone has their fluff to read. friday by robert a. heinlein, aisling by louise cooper, lion''s blood by steven barnes, harry potter, dracula by bram stoker(unabridged), beowulf, and more to name later. the black dagger brotherhood books by j. r. ward are interesting.  movies: beowulf adapted by gaiman. the lord of the rings:rotk the extended version filled my nights with pondering.  music: i have always liked what is now called "classic rock" though when it comes to playing or composing i tend to be more blues oriented. i have a thing for percussion of all types. largely depends on what my mood is at the time. i have over a thousand cd''s in my collection. i have just about every kind of music. what is there not to like save for the stuff that puts people down. as long as it takes you someplace it is very welcome. of late though i am starting to drift back into a darker mood to the music i listen to for the moment. my youtube account has a good representation. music means a lot to me. angus young, henry rollins, danny elfman, jimi hendrix, colin hays, joan jett, robert johnson, tenacious d, concrete blonde, howard jones, metallica, kmfdm, lycia, estampie, rob zombie comprise the beginning of the list of music in my head. at least for today. i really like all kinds of music. i don''t think music has ever left my life and for that i am very thankful. it has the capacity to change the coldest heart and calm the troubled mind. i felt it early on in my soul. i belive music is a language to itself. i would defend music and its right to be played at any cost.  shows: i am into british science fiction shows. firefly. dr. who. red dwarf. hex. supernatural. smallville. painkiller jane. have not watched much else but am enjoying a lot of series on netflix very much. i had a weak spot for forever knight and special unit 2 when they first aired.  food: the one thing that i cannot even stomach is the combination of broccoli and cheese together. just about anything else will work. my weakness is all things made from blueberries. i just cannot pass up anything with them in it. the biggest bummer is when they took the blueberry newtons off the market. i found a substitute but they are not the same. and to think that blueberries are good for you.','connections. love. music. serene moments. laughter. the universe.','experience has shown me that there is no limit to the repercussion that can happen based on a single action. it takes but a moment to connect in a meaningful way.  it is as if by someone actually reading all of this rambling that they could glean something of my personality and find it within them to craft some witty response to what my mind was going through at this time. when all is said and done this sojourn that is life will be what it wanted to be. i am a man of many things.  it also seems very odd to me to consider writing a response to something that obviously by its phrasing at this writing wants a single response and not necessarily a discourse. yet for some reason rather than attempt to write a test for this site i

currently in the (long) process of re-watching "the x-files" from start to finish. i still miss "lost" on a daily basis. as you can tell, i have a weakness for the sci-fi variety, but i also love "mad

depending on the mood  from top 40 to indie rock to hip hop to classical to jazz to experimental. favorites include death cab, stravinsky, common, ray brown, christian mcbride, mingus, and for some

reading books, cooking dinner for friends, expounding on fermented grape juice, really listening to the music (not just as background noise), showing up in a strange country with no plans, being a good listener, enjoying simple pleasures, being reliable, solving problems, accepting existential circumstances, hiking for hours, finding small-town cafes with good breakfast, cuddling and giving affection...','my nice voice (so they say), my honest eyes, my soft-spoken personality. my willingness to listen, understand, and be helpful, my lack of fashion sense, my artistic ambition.','books: i''m a sucker for adventurous historical fiction, like: diana gabaldon, arturo perez reverte, sharon kay penman, guy gavriel kay. also china mieville, which i guess is steam punk, according to the hipsters. biographies on interesting dead people (leonardo, picasso, lincoln), scifi, and the occasional dragon book. films: sexy french noir, anything with space-ships, bond, and guy movies in general. also ensemble casts (like woody allen), coming of age stories (usually better in french), period pieces like remains of the day, gosford park, madness of king george, also rambo, jane austin, you name it really.... food: anything with duck... cassoulet, confit, rillettes. also, pizza, brownies, burgers and fries, warm goat cheese salads, steamed mussels, thai panang curry, tikka masala, sushi, biscuits and gravy...','my camera, a passport, some affection, a car, good music, red wine, cassoulet, health, my cat, my family, my friends, some hope, the horizon, the beach...','thinking about how to find more time to do what really matters in life (or even defining that), and not just be a hamster on the economic wheel making money to pay bills. i''m looking for a quality of life that brings some sense of accomplishment or satisfaction at having done something useful (still working on that one for sure). i admire the european work-to-live mentality more than the american approach of live-to-work. you know, the meaning of life, just little things like that.','watching a dvd on my big-ass plasma and slurping some vintage wine, or heading out of town for a little weekend getaway. since i moved to the east bay, i don''t get out as much as i used to, so a lot of my sf friends think i''ve dropped off the edge of the earth. working on getting back out there now...','i''m pretty happy being alone most of the time, but when i feel the need for affection, i can be very snuggly.','if you are honest and affectionate, witty and/or intelligent, funny, kind, hopefully a little bit cute, into art or at least willing to visit a gallery now and then, not a vegetarian, an enjoyer of red wine, not a heavy-metal or rap music lover, able to walk or hike a few miles and enjoy both nature and the sweat, not too worried about fashion or being cool, comfortable enough with yourself to enjoy both white-trash dives or an evening at the opera... if we have even a few of

(ask me about the story of the sheep onboard the boat.... and how we got the sheep off the boat.) i am banned from riding a moped in two countries. i have made a traditional american feast on the african savanna over an open bonfire with nothing but some chopped beef and a machete.  i have not yet ventured into central america or asia much yet, but i hope to change that soon! also, i have always traveled alone.  i am "a bit" adventurous. i like to travel, planned or not, spur of the moment or not. i can hop on a flight to anywhere with no plans and be just fine. and i''ve done it. and i don''t mean to kansas. i mean to munich, zurich, or prague. when i flew to africa, i flew in without a plan and without knowing anyone. ended up living with a tribe and a rural preacher man and practicing emergency pediatric medical care out in the savanna and the wastes. one of the best experiences of my life.  edit: personality wise, i am no longer a dead split between an estp and an istp. i am a full-fledged istp. http://www.personalitypage.com/istp.html  i enjoy the great outdoors - hiking, camping, backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, caving, spelunking, exploring, etc. i like to be active.  i''m always dreaming about doing more. what can i do more? how can i help more? i like to volunteer and i have a huge desire to go back to school and get into the medical field (nurse, pa, something). one day, i''d like to practice high level medicine overseas. help out in places that need it most.  i am also a total nerd. give me some captain america, iron man, batman, or watchman any day. go avengers! love the movie and love the comic series. i was raised on the transformers and they''ll always have a very special place in my heart. hardcore scifi rocks my world  heinlein, asimov, bradbury, etc. star trek vs star wars? i can''t decide. i was raised on both. there are, however, only three star wars movies. only. three.  i am not a gamer myself, but i can enjoy watching people play games. i like the immersive experience, though due to my background in the government/military, i sometimes avoid the hyper realistic shooters. dead space and halo rock. i haven''t yet watched anyone play mass effect, to which i am told my life is woefully incomplete.  i am a christian and a devout believer in science. i marry the two together for a deeper and richer understanding of reality. can they be two sides of the same coin? studying and keeping up with emerging theories in quantum mechanics is one of my hobbies.  i am also a writer (both non-fiction and pop fiction). i''m working on several more little things, all in the adventure/sci-fi/military realm. recently i''ve become interested in branching out into a post-apocalyptic genre. or zombies.  i work out regularly and keep myself very well in shape.  i love sports. i enjoy watching and playing, especially football. yes, playing football. i joined an amateur men''s tackle football league in texas and played cb and safety. it was an amazing experience. i have a (small) scar on my face from the helmet, a scar on my shoulder from my shoulder pads, a healing crushed nerve in my elbow, and newly recovered torn quads in both legs. i almost broke my nose. my boss begged me to quit. i persevered. i made great tackles. :)  i am not a tree-hugging hippie.','i am a regional project manager for a national firm working at the branch office in austin, tx. i am transferring to the san francisco region imminently. like, any second now.  update - i am being promoted to the fun manager. seriously. :)  before that, i worked in the government. did liaison stuff with the military and a lot of big-sounding action adventure stuff.  i used to be a volunteer emt and search and rescue team member in my spare time. i also did as much overseas disaster relief work as i could. (future dream of practicing medicine overseas) i''d love to get back into that asap. i want to be a sar team member again, and travel abroad much more often.  i am also eating, breathing, and exercising, all on schedule and in order.  i enjoy the wide outdoors and everything from hiking to camping to skiing to sailing. i like to be active and engaged with the world and the people in it. i''m totally happy to go for a day hike, go camping, go wine tasting, go out to the beach, go for a drive, plan a spontaneous event, or what have you.','being modest and talking about myself apparently...  smiling, laughing, playing around, joking, writing, reading, hiking, being adventurous, saving lives, traveling, watching video games, being a back seat video gamer, being fun, being nice, being kind, not cooking, and being awesome.  being a bit of a prankster. not mean pranks. unifying teams kind of pranks. i have a fun and playful sense of humor.  did you notice the not cooking in there? yeah, i''m not much of a cook. if you want to try and teach me, go right ahead. it''s your kitchen. my roommate banned me from our kitchen on the third day. whenever i do try and cook, the smoke detector cheers me on. (and at this point, it just goes off as soon as i turn on the stove. which is just ridiculous. there''s no flame! there''s no smoke! it''s learned behavior at this point, i suspect.)  i am open to learning anything though, including cooking. : )  i am also really good at getting tattoos. i have several, but they are all coverable and i hold a professional white collar job. my tattoos are, of course, awesome, because they''re on me. half are collected from my travels and the other half are total geek and nerd homages. most people love my tattoos and find them awesome, even people who hate tattoos.','my exuberant and sparkling personality and my absolute (and yet quiet) confidence. it can bowl people over sometimes. unintentionally. i''m just that happy, centered, and grounded in myself and my life. its a good thing. :)','i love all food! love exotic and american, casual and classic. i''m good with anything, and i''ve eaten some very exotic food myself. snake is good, squirrel is not. goat is awesome.  movies shoulw be action and adventure or something fun and/or funny. please, no tearjerkers. romantic comedies are okay. intellectual and stimulating movies are preferred as well. i also love sci fi and anything nerdy. i''m a total nerd when it comes down to it, and i love it. i won''t ever admit to how many times i''ve actually seen the avengers movie. and who else is counting down to the new batman movie?  not much for network tv, but i enjoy some netflix watching. top gear, dr who, torchwood, firefly, nat geo , bsg, (oh yes, big bang theory) etc.  i listen to anything and everything. even the crappy stuff. red dirt country, blues, jazz, pop, rock, etc. i. i *especially* love live blues. my new absolute current favorite genre is electro swing. can''t get enough. check out bebo best and the super lounge orchestra sing sing sing. or caravan palace. and, of course, ac/dc and bon jovi will always have a special place.  i read prolifically. everything from the classics (les mis) to the economist. i veer toward non-fiction more than fiction, but i enjoy a good escapist story. i also write, which means i read a ton in research material and fiction fodder.','','all the people i''ve met. how i want to go back overseas, how i want to be a force for good. how i want to help. where in the world do i want to go to next? my team, and what i need to do for them all to succeed. how to champion my people. what to write or create next. dreading the next trip to the grocery store. what''s the cool new tech gadget i have to have? can i turn a flatscreen tv into a table? where can i find an amazing pair of high heels?','recovering from work, looking for a friend to pal around with, or settling down to write. netflix and a glass of wine, dinner with friends, casual bar hopping, or working out. or, planning my weekend excursions to hike, camp, or hop in my car/on a plane and travel somewhere. whatever is called for. : )  most often, quietly recovering from the week. i''m not the totally hyper space cowboy that my profile makes me appear.','i actually am on this mostly on my phone. so i can''t do the chat thing. message me, though, and i will get it. :)  total cop out answer, i know.','you''re grounded in life and know who you are you''re not a tree-hugging hippie you don''t do drugs you''re kind of a nerd, or you have aspirations to be a nerd have a great sense of humor and love wit are super-duper intelligent can spell and type in non-text speak!  i am looking for a warm-hearted, funny, wholesome, integrity-driven person to spend my time with. confidence and intelligence are attractive to me, as is a happiness and contentment with yourself and your life. and, humor is a must! :)',NULL,NULL,'Karen Kelley','https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/11/12/fake-people/4b806cf591a8a76adfc88d19e90c8c634345bf3d/fallbacks/mobile-07.jpg'),

(for those of you using the okc app on your smartphones, there is a link there that you can only see through a web browser.)  i used to think i was a woman trapped in a man''s body (transsexual), but i now realize that i just want people to treat me differently, in the body i''m in. my body isn''t the problem, everybody else''s perception of it is! i don''t identify as either male or female. i currently define myself as intergendered, although the broader terms ¬†genderqueer and "non-binary gender" also fit. my preferred pronouns are neutral ones. they, them, zi, zir, or anything similar are all fine.  i''m too femme for most straight girls to be romantically and/or sexually attracted to me, and have the wrong genitals to be enjoyed by lesbians. this usually leaves me only able to date bisexual and pansexual people. i''m totally fine with only dating these people, i only wish there were more of them, as they are a clear minority. at times, the limited selection makes my romantic life rather difficult.  i always want to be friends before being lovers. i do not do one night stands, and try my best to avoid potentially short lived relationships. that being said, most of my friends are ¬†polyamorous, and so i tend to be polyamorish as well. i date around a lot, but what i''m really searching for is a relationship that will leave me so satisfied in and of itself that i won''t feel a desire to date other people even if i still have the option to. this is something that i know is out there for me; i just need to find the right person. (if you think we''d make good, platonic friends, don''t let this last paragraph keep you from writing to me!)  when i''m in a good mood, i''m generally very flirtatious. and when i do find somebody who i''m really attracted to, i have a tendency to get really giddy, which i personally rather enjoy, but it does have a tendency to make my attraction worry that things are moving too fast. it''s not uncommon for me to be compared to a flirtatious school girl.  i''m at a point in my life where i can''t have sex with anybody solely because i find them physically attractive. i''m almost a demisexual, except i''m just ignoring primary sexual attraction, and only looking for the secondary attraction. this is as opposed to not having primary attraction at all, like a true demisexual would. (for the definitions of demisexual, primary attraction, and secondary attraction, look here: http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=demisexual)  back in the day, the first thing okc had you fill out was three adjectives that describe you. mine are, in no particular order, queer, pragmatic, and nurturing.  i hate money with a passion. there''s nothing fundamentally wrong with money, but the current system is so fucked up that it''s become merely a means of keeping the people currently on top in their places of power. i''m happy making just enough to get by, but i''d be happier with a more meaningful job (i''m actively looking).  in case you noticed that my religion says, "other and somewhat serious about it," and you''re wondering about that, i''m a unitarian universalist. being serious about being a uu really doesn''t involve that much, since the main principles of the religion say that you can believe almost anything you want. around half of us don''t even believe in any deity, including myself. in short, i''m serious about peace, love, constructive debate, a constant desire to learn, and everybody getting along with everyone else.  i really am 6 feet tall, and on the skinny side of average. according to oktrends (http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating), most people lie about seemingly harmless little things, like their height, body condition, and income. i swear, to what ever it is that you believe in, that i have not told even the whitest of lies in my profile.  if you haven''t figured it out yet, my strategy for creating an online dating profile is to include as much about myself as possible in one. i believe that boundless honesty is essential in forming the most meaningful relationships, and that''s what i''m here for, so i''m trying to put as much out front as possible.  i used to act with cincinnati''s local rocky horror picture show cast, the denton affair. shadow acting, but still lots of fun. occasionally, i think about doing more stage work. so far though, i''ve only thought about it. rocky horror really aided in my self discovery.  for anyone that cares, i am a cancer-leo cusp. my birthday is right smack in between the two, and you won''t find more of a cusp than me. i don''t really think it matters, but some people seem to think this makes me extra awesome, so i won''t hold it against you if you do.  i''m a 2 on the kinsey scale, if you assume that i''m male (the kinsey scale doesn''t work with non-binary genders). i''m totally not against cuddling and kissing the right kind of guy, but be aware that there will (probably) be no in-pants action going on! i suppose that this means that i am more ¬†heteroflexible than bisexual. of course, the dilemma with this labeling is: how can i be ''heteroflexible'' if i don''t identify as either of the binary genders? but i have yet to find a more suitable label. the "right kind of guy" is, by the way, more often than not genderqueer, and effeminate, like myself.','i just moved to the bay, from cincinnati, simply because it has been my dream to do so for nearly a decade. i knew that, if i moved out here, i would finally be free to be myself everyday without fear of ridicule, and that my prospects for making would increase. after years of saving, i arrived on april 14th, 2011, with no job lined up, and only a couple of cousins to stay with. after many months of searching, i finally found employment which is slightly gainful, which has allowed me to settle in.  i now live in a wonderful house, in west oakland, with five others who are just as queer as i am. my housemates have become some of my dearest friends, and i know they''re just as happy to have me in their lives as i am to have them in mine. in the short time i''ve been in this city, i''ve made more friends than i''ve ever had before, and life is downright wonderful as a result. in fact i dare say that, aside from my low wage job, i''ve never been happier.  recently, i retook-up painting. i was formally trained with oils, for two years, in high school. painting with oils takes forever, but that''s part of what i like about it. my art from my teenage years was lost, when an ex threw it all in the trash. i can''t replace what was lost, but i''m working on new things now.  i would like to go back to school, once i''ve been in the state for a year, have residency established, and thus cheaper tuition rates.','...writing lengthy profiles about myself. [insert comical drum snare here.]  ...keeping my cool in tense situations. i''m really good at keeping discussions from turning into arguments, even if the other person is irritable. i''m almost always able to help settle disputes between two friends who are too mad at each other to talk otherwise. likewise, you''ll find that no matter how much you scream at me, i''ll never yell back. i have been known to cry though.  ...talking about what''s going on inside my head. this is an especially practical skill for me because apparently my facial expressions can occasionally be very difficult to decipher. i''m also really good at getting other people to talk about what''s going on inside their own heads; i''m very empathic.  i love to sing and dance. i''m pretty good at both, but my singing is definitely better. i really enjoy going out dancing at clubs, so long as they''re not too crowded.  i''m really good at starting conversations, and at breathing new life in to group discussions once they get stale. i''m kind of bad at participating in group discussions though, although i try. i''m strange like this. relatedly, i''m also rather fearless when it comes to talking to strangers, especially if they''re cute.  i enjoy paying attention to politics and occasionally getting pissed off at our government. i read (and very occasionally watch) the news habitually, on a near daily basis.  i have never lost a best two-out-of-three thumb wrestling match. i used to challenge everyone i met, but winning got boring (this was back in my teens). if you think you can beat me, i''ll welcome your contest, but i am totally, 100% serious about never having lost before.  and cooking! not something i do every day, but it''s certainly my most practical skill. i know my way around a spice rack pretty darn well, or at least i like to think so. usually when i cook, it''s a soup or sauce, and it''s almost always vegetarian or vegan. i''m not a vegetarian myself, just health conscious.','usually, the very first thing that people notice about me is that i''m wearing rather femme makeup. if my hair is down, i receive frequent remarks about how long and beautiful it is.  besides the physical, people also notice that i have a lot of courage, often peculiarly accompanied by a difficulty in speaking up. i find it incredibly easy to get on stage, or to just walk up to strangers and attempt to start conversations, but i don''t always have the easiest time chiming in on ongoing conversations. just one of the many ways in which i am an oddball.','i feel that i should tell you that even though i''m cooperating, and making these lists, this is the one section that i always skip over when i first read somebody''s profile. i''m 100% confident that i can be friends, or even lovers, with somebody who has different tastes in entertainment, sources of knowledge, and cuisine than i do.
